//Write a program in C++ that will print "Hello World"
#include <iostream>
int main(){
std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
return 0;
}

//#include <iostream> include the library needed to use std::cout
//int main() : declare the principal function where the program execution begins
//std::cout to display the Hello World text
//std::endl : func that insert a new line character in the ouput stream and flushes the output buffer
//\n : is an escape character that represent a newline, it simply inserts a new line in the output stream without flushing the buffer
//std = standard library
//cout is short for "character output" it is an object that represent the standard output stream
//return 0; to indicate that the programm is succesfull
